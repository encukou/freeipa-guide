            <question>
                <para>Is it possible to change the IP address of the master
                server?</para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>Yes. If you are only changing the IP address, it is
                sufficient to update the 
                <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>file, the system configuration,
                and the DNS entry.</para>

            <question>
                <para>Why are there restrictions on the length of user and
                group names? How can I change this?</para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>User and group name lengths are specified in the policy.
                The default maximum username length is 32 characters. The
                maximum configurable length for user or group names is 255
                characters. This complements some supported client operating
                systems which limit the length of usernames.</para>
                <para>The default settings can be changed in the &IPA; UI or
                using the 
                <command>ipa config-mod</command>command. For example:</para>
                <screen>4 ipa config-mod --maxusername=50</screen>

            <question>
                <para>What is the difference between a replica and a master
                server?</para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>A master server maintains a certificate authority. A
                replica server has its certificate issued by the master
                CA.</para>

            <question>
                <para>
                    Can I promote a replica to function as the master? 
                </para>

            </question>
             <answer>
                <para>
                    Yes. This is described in <xref linkend="promoting-replica" />.

            <question>
                <para>Why does the 
                <command>ipa-client-install</command>script fail to find the
                IPA server on a network that uses Active Directory DNS?</para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>Active Directory has its own SRV records for Kerberos and
                LDAP. The 
                <command>ipa-client-install</command>script can retrieve those
                records instead of any that have been added for the &IPA;
                domain.</para>
                <para>When running 
                <command>ipa-client-install</command>, manually enter the
                server information to ensure that the script uses the &IPA; SRV
                records instead of &AD; records. The 
                <command>ipa-client-install</command>options are listed in the 
                <command>ipa-client-install</command>manpage.</para>

            <question>
                <para>Can an administrator who is connected to "Server&nbsp;B"
                revoke a certificate issued by "Server&nbsp;A"?</para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>Yes, assuming that Servers A and B contain non-cloned CAs
                which have their database information replicated to share
                revocation information only.</para>
