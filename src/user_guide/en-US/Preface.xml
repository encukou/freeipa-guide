	<para>
		&PROD; is a &OS;-based way to create a security, identity, and authentication domain. The different security
		and authentication protocols available to Linux and Unix systems (like Kerberos, NIS, DNS, PAM, and sudo) are
		complex, unrelated, and difficult to manage coherently, especially when combined with different identity stores.
	</para>
	<para>
		&PROD; provides a layer that unifies all of these disparate services and simplifies the administrative tasks for
		managing users, systems, and security. &IPA; breaks management down into two categories: <emphasis>identity</emphasis> and
		<emphasis>policy</emphasis>. It centralizes the functions of managing the users and entities within your IT environment (identity) and
		then provides a framework to define authentication and authorization for a global security framework and user-friendly
		tools like single sign-on (policy).

			With &PROD;, a &OS; system can easily become the center of an identity/authentication domain and even provide access to the domain for clients of other operating systems.
			&IPA; is an integrated system, that builds on existing and reliable technologies like LDAP and certificate protocols, with a robust yet
			straightforward set of tools (including a web-based UI). The key to identity/policy management with &IPA; is simplicity and flexibility:

					Centralized identity stores for authentication and single sign-on using both integrated LDAP services (with 389 &DS;) and, optionally, NIS services
				</para>

					Clear and manageable administrative control over system services like PAM, NTP, and sudo

					Scalable Kerberos realms and cross-realms which clients can easily join
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>
			This guide is written for systems administrators and IT staff who will manage &IPA; domains, user systems, and servers. This assumes a moderate knowledge of
			Linux-based systems administration and familiarity with important concepts like access control, LDAP, and Kerberos.
		</para>
		<para>
			This guide covers every aspect of
			using &IPA;, including preparation and installation processes, administrative tasks, and the &IPA; tools. This guide also explains the major concepts
			behind both identity and policy management, generally, and &IPA; features specifically. Administrative tasks in this guide are categorized as either <emphasis>Identity</emphasis>
			or <emphasis>Policy</emphasis> in the chapter title to help characterize the administrative functions.
